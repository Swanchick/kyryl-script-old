# Note: This is last Public Snapshot of KyrylScript

This repository contains the last open-source version of KyrylScript prior to the development of its new virtual machine.

The current VM and the new Anchor System memory model are under active development and not publicly available yet.
This snapshot remains public to demonstrate the design direction, language features, and architectural approach.

If you would like to evaluate the latest version, collaborate, or request access for research or technical review, feel free to contact me at:

# KyrylScript

**KyrylScript** is a lightweight interpreted programming language designed and built from scratch in Rust.  
It combines the simplicity of scripting with the clarity of structured typing, offering a unique reference-based runtime without garbage collection.

> A spiritual successor to Lua, with the structural rigor of Rust and the flexibility of Python.

## Features

- **Custom Lexer and Parser**
  - Hand-written in Rust, with clear syntax trees and tokenization rules.

- **Runtime and Scoping**
  - Lexical scoping with reference-based variable tracking.
  - No garbage collector — all memory is managed manually using reference IDs.

- **Type System**
  - Built-in support for numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, functions, and native values.

- **Control Structures**
  - If/else, while loops, pattern matching, recursion, scoped blocks.

- **Native Function Registry**
  - Easily extend the language by registering native Rust functions with the runtime.
